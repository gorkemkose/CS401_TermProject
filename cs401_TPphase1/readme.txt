This folder contains 3 assembly source codes:
- Sbox implementation using small tables approach
- Sbox implementation using large tables approach
- L(X) function implementation

Also, a Python file is attached to transparently demonstrate:
- How the table merging step is accomplished for large tables method
- How 100 16-bit integers are generated

Lastly, 2 screenshots of the cache performance for large tables and small tables approach.

In the next phases, S(X) and L(X) functions will be implemented within the same file in order to achieve L(S(X)).
